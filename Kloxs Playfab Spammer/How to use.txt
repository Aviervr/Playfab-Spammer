To run on windows

To run the file first run the install.bat file by the way
using that way to run is windows only because its a batch file im not
going to get into why its windows only next you need to open a command promt
for this next part make sure you have python installed python.org
in that folder next type "py main.py" then you enter in the playfab id and
the name for the users to be generated then click enter and there u go

To run on Linux

You guys on linux already probaly know how to run a python file lmao
basicly the same thing as above but it might give u an error so in your 
cmd type "pip install colarama" and right after its finished installing that
type "pip install playfab" and ru nthe file again
